suggestions:
possibly adding something to crit damage - bow item?
an amulet -> increases crit chance?
classes - swashbuckler, etc
ability to miss attacks
UI Overhaul
Luck on victory panel doesnt have space between number and colon
Show not enough money notification
display stats of items
add drop shadow or outline for damage text

other:
update README.md to reflect music changes
add sound options? (Volume)
add pause menu
tutorial
highscore

things to think about but no solution to:
stat allocation too small?
spread the min/max damage of enemies

maybe?? (suspected bugs but not 100%?):
sound is slightly delayed? (only on my phone)

patch notes:
axey 23-46 -> 15-30
several new items
