fix:

important:
shield - reduce the damage on crit
fade spells when you run out of mana

other:
text can be wrong color sometimes
tap to start doesnt exist on title
update README.md to reflect music changes
add sound options? (Volume)
icons arent clear
stat allocation too small?
add explanation of stats?
spread the min/max damage of enemies

maybe?? (suspected bugs but not 100%?):
once beat the first wave on endless - not continuing
