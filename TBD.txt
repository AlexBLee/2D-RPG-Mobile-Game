fix:

important:

intelligence not viable
	magic sucks - up the spells? or get spells faster!

shield - reduce the damage on crit
level isnt updating correctly on panel	



other:
update README.md to reflect music changes
add sound options? (Volume)
icons arent clear
stat allocation too small?
add explanation of stats?
spread the min/max damage of enemies

maybe?? (suspected bugs but not 100%?):
once beat the first wave on endless - not continuing
