possibly adding something to crit damage - bow item?
an amulet -> increases crit chance?
classes - swashbuckler, etc
UI Overhaul

other:
update README.md to reflect music changes
add sound options? (Volume)
add pause menu


things to think about but no solution to:
stat allocation too small?
spread the min/max damage of enemies

maybe?? (suspected bugs but not 100%?):
sound is slightly delayed? (only on my phone)
