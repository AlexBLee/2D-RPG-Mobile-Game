fix:
intelligence not viable
lower magic wand price
randomize money
remove final fantasy music
armor a little too expensive
will -> luck!!
being able to sell would be good!
add sound options? (Volume)
can trash axe other times but not other times (implement a sell thing)
shield - reduce the damage on crit
colour some text!
add explanation of stats?
spread the min/max damage of enemies
magic sucks - up the spells? or get spells faster!
once beat the first wave on endless - not continuing
iOS app store maybe??
icons arent clear
stat allocation too small?
